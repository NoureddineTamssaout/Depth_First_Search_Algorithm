# Depth_First_Search_Algorithm
Depth-first search (DFS) is a method for traversing a tree or graph data structure. It involves searching through the nodes of the graph by following a path from the starting node to the end node, and then backtracking when the end is reached or there are no more nodes to explore, it is also implementing a LIFO list.
This code  is its recursive version, it involves defining a function that performs the search and calls itself recursively on each unexplored child node of the current node.
